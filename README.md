# Dress-Attributes-and-Sales-Data---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to dress attributes and sales. I began by importing the necessary libraries and then proceeded to read and merge the "Attribute DataSet" with the "Dress Sales" dataset. After merging the data, I performed various analyses to explore relationships and patterns within the combined dataset, setting the foundation for deeper insights into the attributes and sales performance of different dress styles.
